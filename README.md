# Weather Analysis with Random Forest

This project uses a **Random Forest Regressor** to analyze and predict weather data, focusing on maximum daily temperatures. Data was collected using the **Open-Meteo API** and processed to include various weather features like precipitation, wind speed, and radiation.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Random Forest model training and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Evaluation with metrics: MSE, MAE, and RÂ²
- Feature importance analysis

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/weather-analysis-with-rf.git
   cd weather-analysis-with-rf
